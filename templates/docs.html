                <h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
                <p>Each organization is represented as an entity and has:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>n number of users.</li>
                    <li>n number of projects.</li>
                    <li>a single payment entity, can be managed by multiple persons inside the organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="user-types">User Types</h2>
                <p>There are two types of users: <strong>Contributors</strong> and <strong>Collaborators</strong>.</p>
                
                <h3>Contributors</h3>
                <p>Contributors have the following permissions and responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Invite and manage users within the organization.</li>
                    <li>Approve and oversee tasks and milestones.</li>
                    <li>Access to all levels of the project, including ticket and post levels.</li>
                    <li>Can perform bulk updates and manage user roles within the system.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Collaborators</h3>
                <p>Collaborators have the following permissions and responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to tickets and posts within assigned segments.</li>

                <h2 id="registration">Registration and User Management</h2>
                <p>The first user to register for an organization will have to invite the remaining users by allowing them access to specific segments or the entire organization sub-domain. This user can also assign the contributor user role to invited users.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If an organization already exists, new users need to contact their contributor for access.</li>
                    <li>Payment is managed at the organization level, with a single payment account sufficient for all users within an organization.</li>
                    <li>Any root user or contributor within the organization can handle payments.</li>
                    <li>Deleted organizations can be reactivated within 3 months, after which new registrations may be required under a different organization name.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="soft-deletion">Soft Deletion and Data Retention</h2>
                <p>Organizations and user accounts that are marked for deletion will remain in the system for a period of 3 months. During this period, if a user wants to reactivate their account or organization, they can contact us for manual restoration.</p>
